This NLP project is a very innocent attempt at predicting the stock market sentiment using unsupervised learning. 
As a dataset, Indian news headlines spanning over several years are collected. The labelling of the dataset .i.e. whether the particular 
headline will have a positive or negative affect on the stock market has been done manually by the authors. Now, using the Turney's algo,
authors try to estimate the semantic orientation of the news headline. The accuracy of the algorithm is calculated by comparing sentiment 
predicted be the algorithm vs the sentiment entered manually.
